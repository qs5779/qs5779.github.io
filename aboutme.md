### My story

No, I do not speak Spanish. I know only a few words, many of which
shouldn't be used outside Donald's locker room.

When I was young I read a lot of books. Living in a rural community in
East Texas, there was not much else that could be done when there was idle time available.
Many of the books I read were second hand paperbacks my uncle brought for grandmother and I
from the VA Hospital where he worked.

I recall reading a lot of detective books, mostly by Earl Stanley Gardner as A.A. Fair.
I also read a lot western novels. I can't recall the author's name but in everyone of his
books he use the Spanish phrase, &ldquo;&iquest;Qui√©n sabe?&rdquo;, followed by the translation,
&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; I have searched several times
trying to find that author's identity, but this far I have not been successfull.
Please contact me if you think you know his (or her) identity.

I have used several psuedoyms during my lifetime as I navigated the virtual world.
Quien Sabe is the latest, and undoubted my last.

I hope you have found something here of interest, but regardless thanks for stopping by.
